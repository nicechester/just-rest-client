# Just REST Client

Just REST Client is a lightweight, single-page application (SPA) client built to test and interact with RESTful APIs. It features variable templating, configurable HTTP methods, and a dedicated response viewer for body, headers, and script output.

## 🔗 Live Deployment

You can access the live version of the application here:

## ✨ Features

- **Variable Templating**: Use `{{variableName}}` syntax in your URL and request body.
- **Request Configuration**: Select HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH).
- **Detailed Response View**: Separate panels for Status, Time, Processed URL, Response Body (with syntax highlighting), Response Headers, and Script Output.
- **Post-Request Scripting (Planned)**: Functionality to run custom JavaScript after a request to parse the response and set new variables.
- **Responsive UI**: Built with Tailwind CSS for optimal viewing on desktop and mobile.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To use the client, follow these steps:

### 1. Configure the Request

- **Select Method**: Choose the desired HTTP method from the dropdown (e.g., GET, POST).
- **Enter URL**: Input the target API endpoint into the URL text box. You can use global variables here (e.g., `{{baseUrl}}/users/{{userId}}`).
- **Request Body**: If using POST, PUT, or PATCH, enter the data payload (e.g., JSON) into the Request Body area.

### 2. Variables (Sidebar)

- **View Defaults**: The application starts with default variables (e.g., `baseUrl`, `userId`). These are used for testing variable substitution.
- **Variable Substitution**: When you click **Send Request**, any string enclosed in double curly braces (`{{...}}`) in the URL or Body is replaced with the corresponding value from the internal variable store.

### 3. Send and View Response

- Click the **Send Request** button.
- The application will process the request, substitute variables, and execute the fetch.
- The main panel will automatically switch to the **Response** tab.

#### Response Details:

- **Response Body**: Shows the server's payload, formatted for readability (JSON is automatically parsed and pretty-printed).
- **Response Headers**: Lists all headers returned by the server.
- **Script Output**: (Currently shows a placeholder message) This area is reserved for logs and messages generated by the post-request script.

## 🛠️ Development & Architecture

The Just REST Client is a modern web application designed with modularity in mind, using ES Modules for separation of concerns.

### Project Structure

The JavaScript logic is divided into the following modules:

- **`app.js`**: The main entry point. Handles UI initialization, state management, and event handlers (like the "Send Request" button click). It orchestrates the flow between the UI and the other modules.
- **`request.js`**: Contains the core logic for executing the fetch request, applying variable templates to the URL and Body, and handling the response and error states.
- **`variable.js`**: Manages the global variable store, providing `setVariable` and `getVariableStore` functions.
- **`scripting.js`**: (Placeholder) Responsible for executing the user-defined JavaScript code after the API request is complete.
- **`storage.js`**: Handles data persistence using `localStorage` for variables, saved requests, and scripts.

### Technologies Used

- **HTML5 / CSS3**
- **JavaScript (ES Modules)**
- **Tailwind CSS**: For utility-first styling and responsive design.

## 📝 Roadmap

Future planned features include:

- Full implementation of the Variables editor for user configuration.
- Full implementation of Scripts editor and execution flow.
- Collections management for saving and organizing requests.
- Support for form data, URL parameters, and authentication methods (e.g., Bearer Tokens).
